## Overview

TechTreasure is a web application designed to simulate buying and selling of PC hardware components. Drawing inspiration from platforms like hardverapr√≥.hu and vinted.hu, my project aims to provide a user-friendly experience for trading computer parts. The project is dependent on another project, CloudImage (https://github.com/Shanyik/CloudImage), which serves as an image hosting service.
